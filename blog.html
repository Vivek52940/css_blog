	<h2>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
	<p class="quote">The modern definition of artificial intelligence (or AI) is "the study and design of intelligent agents" where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximizes its chances of success.</p>

John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1956, defines it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines."
Other names for the field have been proposed, such as computational intelligence, synthetic intelligence or computational rationality.The term artificial intelligence is also used to describe a property of machines or programs: the intelligence that the system demonstrates.AI research uses tools and insights from many fields, including computer science, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, operations research, economics, control theory, probability, optimization and logic.AI research also overlaps with tasks such as robotics, control systems, scheduling, data mining, logistics, speech recognition, facial recognition and many others.Computational intelligence Computational intelligence involves iterative development or learning (e.g., parameter tuning in connectionist systems).Learning is based on empirical data and is associated with non-symbolic AI, scruffy AI and soft computing.

	<h2>FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT</h2>
	<p class="quote">Full stack development refers to the development of both front end and back end portions of an application. This web development process involves all three layer- Presentation layer(front end part that deals with the user interface), Business Logic Layer(back end part that deals with data validation) and the database Layer. It takes care of all the steps from the conception of an idea to the actual finished product.</p>
	<p class="article">Companies are looking at hiring web developers who are experts in all facets of the web development process. They are looking at people who can play different roles like a designer, developer, and database specialist. Specialist in single subsystems like only front-end or back end cannot understand the bigger picture of the entire system. Moreover, when multiple experts work on the development process it becomes complex and time consuming. Coordination and strategizing also become an issue. That is why Full stack developers are the most sought after by companies today. Though there are several courses that one can do to learn different technologies, these courses are only a few pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. Even after learning a few of these technologies one will not understand how these pieces fit in to complete the puzzle. With a full stack web development course, you can gain expertise in multiple technologies and also learn how they work in sync with each other. These courses provide a seamless transition from a simple developer to a full stack developer. The developer learns how to use different technologies to design, develop, and launch the website.</p>
